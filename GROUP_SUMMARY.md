# Group Summary for Our Overview of MongoDB

## Overview and Goals
__Group Members:__ Kyle Day, Biruk Mengistu, Noah Constable

Our project was a presentation on the architecture, features, and operations of MongoDB. In doing so, we highlighted the quirks of MongoDB as a database-management platform, made comparisons to SQL as appropriate, and provided insight into how MongoDB functions before being interfaced with popular programming languages.

5.  Demonstrate how to work with MongoDB via CRUD operations<br>
    a. Creating collections&#10003;<br>
    b. Creating databases&#10003;<br>
    c. Creating documents&#10003;<br>
    d. CRUD operations&#10003;
6.  Explore MongoDB's integration with other tools and frameworks&#10003;

### End Result and Shared Tasks
We managed to fulfill all of the tasks assigned to us by the Friday of our presentation, allowing us to edit things down and relay our information at a comfortable pace.

In addition, there were a few shared tasks. We worked together to ensure that our presentation was structured in a cohesive manner so as to provide comfortable transitions between the different topics we covered. We aimed to go from broad to specific in each of our sections.
